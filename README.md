☀️ Solar Power Generation Forecasting
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting solar power generation for two solar power plants using weather sensor and generation data. It leverages time-series analysis and predictive modeling to estimate the energy output based on environmental conditions.

📁 Datasets Used:
Plant_1_Generation_Data.csv & Plant_2_Generation_Data.csv: Contain timestamped data on DC/AC power, daily yield, and total yield from each inverter.

Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv & Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv: Include ambient temperature, module temperature, and solar irradiation readings from weather sensors.

🔍 Key Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing of timestamped sensor and power output data.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand performance trends across plants.

Correlation analysis between environmental factors and power output.

Power generation forecasting using machine learning or statistical models.
